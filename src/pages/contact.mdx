# Contact Me

You can get in touch with me by opening 
the closest window and yelling out of it real loud.


## Or you can wave to me

Just click this button to simulate a friendly wave.


<Wave />


Please note that I may not wave back.
This is because I am very far away and
probably I didn't see you clicl this button.
